# Advanced Deep Learning Final Project

## Task

Develop and compare two deep learning models (LSTM and DistilBERT) forsentiment analysis on Yelp reviews to determine the overall sentiment (positive,negative, neutral) expressed within a review. Utilize a dataset of Yelp reviews,focusing on businesses like restaurants or hotels. These reviews often containsubjective opinions and sentiments toward various aspects of the service or product.Analyze and compare the strengths and weaknesses of LSTM and Transformermodels for sentiment analysis on this specific dataset. Train the LSTM andDistilBERT models on the pre-processed and labelled Yelp review data forsentiment classification. Evaluate the performance of both models on a held-out testset of Yelp reviews using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.Explore hyperparameter tuning for both models to optimize their performance.Analyze the types of reviews where each model performs better (e.g., short vs. longreviews, specific vocabulary usage). Consider including visualization techniques tounderstand how each model interprets and classifies sentiment within the reviews.Conduct a comparative analysis to understand the strengths and weaknesses of eachmodel on this specific task
